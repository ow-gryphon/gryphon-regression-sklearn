Preview notebooks here:
- [Variable selection for linear models](https://github.com/ow-gryphon/gryphon-regression-sklearn/blob/main/template/notebooks/regression/%5Btemplate%5D%20sklearn%20Linear%20Model%20Variable%20Selection.ipynb) such as stepwise selection. You can also build tree-ensemble models (random forest, gradient boosting etc.) to help identify powerful variables
- [Calibration and model fit of sklearn regressions](https://github.com/ow-gryphon/gryphon-regression-sklearn/blob/main/template/notebooks/regression/%5Btemplate%5D%20sklearn%20Model%20Calibration%20and%20Fit.ipynb)
- More notebooks to come soon.
